				<h1>REAKTION</h1>
				<h2>by Rezo Drone</h2>
				<p>I'll show you everything.<br>
				The truth behind the veil.<br>
				I'll give you everything,<br>
				Then take it all away.<br>
				<br>
				Love is a reaction.<br>
				<br>
				Just a distraction,<br>
				A game that I'll always play.<br>
				<br>
				You could be the only,<br>
				Not just the lonely,<br>
				But you keep running away.<br>
				<br>
				Time is an illusion.<br>
				Have no confusion.<br>
				There's just the here and the now.<br>
				<br>
				Why are you the reason<br>
				That I'm believing<br>
				We could have freedom somehow?<br>
				<br>
				I'll show you everything.<br>
				The truth behind the veil.<br>
				I'll give you everything,<br>
				Then take it all away.<br>
				<br>
				Choking on your delusion,<br>
				Fatally wounded,<br>
				<br>
				I'm just a desperate shell,<br>
				<br>
				Raising up out of ashes,<br>
				<br>
				Broken and tragic,<br>
				Dry in a desolate well.<br>
				<br>
				Don't need another second,<br>
				<br>
				Just take the pill and swallow.<br>
				Your thoughts belong to me now,<br>
				<br>
				The only one you follow.<br>

				I can't feel anything at all.<br>
				How could I let you<br>
				Open me up and watch me fall?<br>
				Never lift me up.</p>
